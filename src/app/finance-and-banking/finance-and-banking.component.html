        We all know that life can spring unpleasant surprises on us, such as a job loss or a medical emergency that
        will need money.
      </div>
      <div class="chaptercontent w-richtext">
        <p>
          That’s why financial planning and knowing about how to manage your money is important.
        </p>

        <div class="chaptercontent w-richtext">
          <p>
            Managing your finances means you need to understand about banking and how to budget and save. It is also important to know about debt,
            loans and insurance.
          </p>
          <div class="section-header">FINANCIAL PLANNING</div>
          <p>
            Financial planning helps you to use your money wisely. One of the key factors in financial
            planning and management is saving money each month. This gives you a safety net for
            when you need it most, and can help you during emergencies.
          </p>
          <p><strong>BUDGETING</strong></p>

          <p>Budgeting means keeping an accurate track of your income (money coming in) and
            expenses (money going out), so that you can see clearly where your money is going.
            Keeping a monthly budget makes you face reality. It helps you to manage your money
            wisely</p>

          <p>
            Sticking to a monthly budget needs discipline and commitment, but it will help you stay
            out of debt by making sure you keep control of your expenses. When you can easily
            see what your necessary and unnecessary expenses are, it’s easier to decide what to
            cut back on.
          </p>

          <ul>
              <li><strong>Income:</strong> Your income is what you earn every month. It could be from wages or a
                salary, or casual payment for odd jobs, or earnings from sales</li>
              <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> Expenses are what you spend money on every month. They can be ‘fixed’
                expenses (the ones you can’t change, like rent, electricity, water, food, transport,
                school fees, and monthly savings) or ‘variable’ expenses (things you can cut back
                on, like clothing and entertainment).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            At the end of the month, subtract your expenses from your income. Ideally, you should
            have some money left over. These are your savings (see page 172). You should try to
            avoid debt by never having higher expenses than your income.

          <div class="section-header">BANKING</div>
          <p>
            There are two kinds of financial institutions in South Africa:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The formal sector is dominated by big commercial banks, and smaller financial
              institutions, such as Postbank, and savings and credit cooperatives. </li>
            <li>nformal banking options include unlicenced moneylenders, burial societies, rotating
              saving and credit associations (ROSCAs) and stockvels, which mainly provide
              financial services to people without access to bank accounts in both rural and urban
              areas.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>

          <strong>PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY BANKS</strong>
          <p>
            All commercial banks offer a wide range of services and products, including different
            types of accounts, investments opportunities, loans, insurance, overdraft facilities,
            revolving credits, as well as self-service banking such as telephone banking, internet
            banking and ATMs. There are branches throughout South Africa where you can also get
            assistance in person.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before committing to a particular bank, do some research. Look at the products and
            services the bank is offering and assess if they meet your needs in terms of monthly
            fees, interest rates and customer service.
          </p>

          <p>
            With advances in technology, you don’t have to visit a branch to do your day-to-day
            banking. You can perform transactions via the following channels at any time of the day:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong><em>ATM banking</em></strong>ATMs (or automated teller machines) offer the option to perform
              financial transactions without entering a branch. Most banks have a national network
              of ATMs for easy access to your bank account.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Cellphone banking: </strong></em>You can perform a range of transactions safely through a dial-up
              session on your cellphone. Some banks also have smartphone applications (‘apps’)
              that you can download and use on your cellphone. </li>
            <li><em><strong>Telephone banking:</strong></em> You can do your banking over the telephone. Most banks offer
              this service 24 hours a day, and you can choose between the voice-recording option
              (self-help) or speaking to a consultant directly</li>
            <li><em><strong>Internet banking:</strong></em>: You can log in to your bank account via your bank’s secure website
              to manage your money online.</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>OPENING A BANK ACCOUNT</strong>
          <p>
            There are many different types of accounts offered by banks in South Africa. These
            include the following:
          </p>
          <uL>
            <li>Access or saving accounts.</li>
            <li>Cheque or current accounts.</li>
            <li>Mzansi accounts</li>
            <li>Money market or investment accounts.</li>
          </uL>

          <p>
            Which account you choose will depend on your financial situation – whether you have a
            job or regular income, and what your current and future needs are likely to be.
          </p>

          <p>To open most bank accounts, you’ll need the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some money as an opening deposit.</li>
            <li>Your green barcoded South African identity document or the new smart identity card.</li>
            <li>Proof of residence: This could be a lease (if you’re renting), or a recent electricity
              or phone bill that has your name and physical address on it. If you are living with
              someone who owns or rents the home, you will need him/her to confirm in writing
              that you live together. He/she will also need to provide his/her ID number and proof
              of residence.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For non-South African citizens, you’ll need:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A valid passport.</li>
            <li>Proof of residence.</li>
            <li>Work permit.</li>
            <li>Employment contract.</li>
          </ul>
