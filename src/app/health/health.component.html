        Women play a very important role in the health and well-being of their families
        and communities. They look after the young, the elderly, the sick and the disabled.
      </div>
      <div class="chaptercontent w-richtext">
        <p>
          In order to be able to do this properly, women must take care of themselves too.
        </p>

        <p>
          Look after yourself by getting enough sleep (at least eight hours every night), eating well (lots of fresh
          fruit and vegetables if you can), being physically active, and keeping a positive attitude.

        <div class="section-header">Health Assessment</div>
        <p>
          Women need to have regular health check-ups to help them stay healthy. A health assessment will alert you to
          any health risks, and your doctor will then help you to manage these. You should try to have a medical
          check-up once every year.
        </p>

        <p>Diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and some cancers can be picked up in their
          early stages when treatment is often more effective and can lead to a cure. If you have risk factors, such
          as a family history of a disease, it may be more likely that you will develop that disease.
        </p>
        <p>At your check-up, talk to your doctor about your medical history, your family’s history of disease, and your
          lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise and if you smoke or drink alcohol.</p>

        <div><strong>VISITING THE DOCTOR</strong></div>
        <p>Before you go to the doctor, make sure you have everything you need, including medical
          aid or insurance and past medical records. You should also make a list of questions you
          may want to ask the doctor.</p>

        <p>Keep your medical records updated with the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Menstrual history.</li>
          <li>Pregnancy history.</li>
          <li>Family medical history.</li>
          <li>Your own medical history (including any surgeries).</li>
          <li>Medications/supplements you may be taking: Take these with you, in their correct
            containers. This helps the doctor know what medicine to prescribe to avoid a clash
            with what you are already taking.
          </li>
          <li>The results of clinical tests such as blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, iron levels,
            Pap smear, or breast examination.

        <p>When you visit the doctor, it’s very important that you answer all the questions honestly.
          Don’t leave out anything, even if it makes you feel embarrassed.
        </p>
        <p>If you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, you can ask for someone else to be with you (a
          friend or a nurse) when the doctor examines you.
        </p>

        <p>Tell the doctor:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>About your symptoms.</li>
          <li>When did it start?</li>
          <li>Has it happened before?</li>
          <li>Has anyone else in your family had a similar problem?</li>
          <li>Are you currently taking any medications?</li>
          <li>Have you had any medical problems before?</li>
          <li>Have you had surgery before?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ask the doctor:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To explain to you what is wrong</li>
          <li>To explain about your medication: When must you take it? How must you take it? Are
            there any side effects? Will it affect your other medication (e.g. contraceptive pills)?
          </li>
          <li>If you need to come back for a follow-up.</li>
          <li>Any other questions you might have.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After the visit:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Follow the doctor’s instructions.</li>
          <li>Report any side effects.</li>
          <li>Go back to the doctor if you’re not feeling better within two to four days.</li>

          Healthy eating, including lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, and home-cooked meals rather
          than fast food, is important for your health. By making healthier choices about what you eat,
          you can prevent or reverse many health problems associated with poor diet, such as obesity,
          anaemia, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and high cholesterol.

        <p>Good foods include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Whole grains</strong> such as oatmeal and wholewheat bread.</li>
          <li><strong>Fruit and vegetables</strong> (try to eat three

        <p>
          A chronic disease is a medical condition that lasts a long time – from a few months to an
          entire lifetime. Most chronic diseases are caused by poor lifestyle choices, such as not
          eating well or not getting enough exercise. Some are caused by exposure to environmental
          hazards, such as certain chemicals, while some are inherited (you’re born with them).

        <p>
          Research shows that one in four south African women may develop some form of

        <div><strong>Heart attack</strong></div>
        <p>
          A heart attack usually happens when a blood clot blocks the fl ow of blood through an
          artery (a blood vessel that feeds oxygen-rich blood to the heart). this can damage or
          destroy part of the heart.
        </p>

        <p>Warning signs and symptoms of heart attack:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>chest pain that may feel like a heavy weight on the chest or a tightness around the
            chest.

        <div><strong>STROKE</strong></div>
        <p>
          A stroke happens when a blood vessel to the brain ruptures or breaks or when a blood
          vessel to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may mean that part of the brain can’t
          get enough blood, and therefore is not getting enough oxygen. This can lead to that part
          of the brain dying. A stroke can cause serious disability or even death.
        </p>

        <p>Risk factors for stroke:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Having high blood pressure.</li>
          <li>Having diabetes.</li>
          <li>Women who smoke and are on the Pill.</li>
          <li>An unhealthy lifestyle, including a high-fat diet.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Warning signs and symptoms of a stroke:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sudden weakness or numbness in the face, arm or leg on one side of the body.</li>
          <li>Sudden difficulty speaking or understanding.</li>
          <li>Problems with vision, especially loss of vision in only one eye.</li>
          <li>A sudden, very bad headache with no obvious cause.</li>
          <li>A sudden loss of balance, which gets worse when you bend or cough.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A stroke is a medical emergency. if you feel like you’re having a stroke, get medical
          attention immediately.

        <div><strong>HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</strong></div>
        <p>
          High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a chronic condition where the force
          of the blood pushing against the blood-vessel walls is stronger than it should be. this
          means the heart has to work harder to circulate blood through the body. It can also
          damage the lining of the blood vessels.
        </p>
        <p>
          High blood pressure contributes to hardening of the arteries, stroke, kidney disease and
          the development of heart failure.
        </p>

        <p>Risk factors for high blood pressure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ethnicity (black women are more likely to develop high blood pressure).</li>
          <li>Having a family history of high blood pressure.</li>
          <li>Being overweight or obese.</li>
          <li>Having diabetes.</li>
          <li>Smoking.</li>
          <li>Not getting enough exercise.</li>
          <li>Pregnancy (for some women).</li>
        </ul>

        <div><strong>The 'silent killer'</strong></div>
        <p>
          New research says that south Africa has the highest rate of high blood pressure
          reported among people aged 50 and over in the world, with consistently higher levels
          among women.
        </p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <p class="info-box-text">A 2014 study (Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health, conducted by the World
            Health Organization) says that only about one-third of people who tested positive
            for high blood pressure even knew they had it. This is why high blood pressure is
            often called the ‘silent killer’ – often, there are no symptoms.

        <div><strong>HIGH CHOLESTEROL</strong></div>
        <p>
          Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood. it is naturally produced mostly in the liver but
          some cholesterol comes from the foods you eat, such as red meat, fi sh, eggs and dairy products.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your body needs a little bit of cholesterol to help your brain, skin and other organs
          grow and function. But if your body cannot process cholesterol or you eat food high in
          cholesterol, this can affect your general health.
