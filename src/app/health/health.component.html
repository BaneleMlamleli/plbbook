        Women play a very important role in the health and well-being of their families
        and communities. They look after the young, the elderly, the sick and the disabled.
      </div>
      <div class="chaptercontent w-richtext">
        <p>
          In order to be able to do this properly, women must take care of themselves too.
        </p>

        <p>
          Look after yourself by getting enough sleep (at least eight hours every night), eating well (lots of fresh
          fruit and vegetables if you can), being physically active, and keeping a positive attitude.
        </p>

        <div class="section-header">Health Assessment</div>
        <p>
          Women need to have regular health check-ups to help them stay healthy. A health assessment will alert you to
          any health risks, and your doctor will then help you to manage these. You should try to have a medical
          check-up once every year.
        </p>

        <p>Diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and some cancers can be picked up in their
          early stages when treatment is often more effective and can lead to a cure. If you have risk factors, such
          as a family history of a disease, it may be more likely that you will develop that disease.
        </p>
        <p>At your check-up, talk to your doctor about your medical history, your familyâ€™s history of disease, and your
          lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise and if you smoke or drink alcohol.</p>
